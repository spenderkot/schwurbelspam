Spam the Schwurbler, Spam the Nazi

Random fake ID generator for Martin

Needed:
- Linux/macOS (maybe Windows, if you have node 14+)
- npm

Installation:
- go to git folder

You will encounter errors while executing sometimes. But it does what it should do.

Big shoutout to Martin, you should get proper education on setting up something like this (and probably on a lot of other stuff too).

Best regards,
